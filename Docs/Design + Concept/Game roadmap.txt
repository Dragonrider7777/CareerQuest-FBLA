Step 1: Define Concept & Design
    Create a "blueprint" that can always be looked back to
    - Define the hub world (Where user can pick what career they want to look at)
    - Choose 2-3 career mini-worlds to start (Doctor, Project Manager, Teacher) and describe scenarios for each world
    - Design skill-based challenges UNIQUE to each profession
    - ENSURE EACH CAREER TEACHES A REAL SKILL
    - Map the game flow: hub -> career world -> challenge -> reward -> hub or quit

Step 2: Visual & UX Planning
    - Pick a consistent art style (Probably something simple like cartoon)
    - Create or find UI mockups that will STAY consistent throughout game
        ex. Menus, buttons, popups
    - Plan controls (Keyboard and mouse)
    - Ensure easy readibility with clear labels and instructions

Step 3: The Technical Setup
    - Developing in Unity and making scripts through VS Code
    - Setup folder structure in an organized way and include notes in folder
    - Build basic prototype consisting of a hub world and one career mini-world
    - Use version control and create GitHub repository

Step 4: Deployment & Iteration
    - Once initial bugs are sorted out, add additional career worlds
    - Add smooth transitions between menus or worlds
    - Implement an exit system (Maybe save if have time?)
    - Playtest each world
    - optimize, optimize, optimize
    - Refer back to rubric

Step 5: Create Documentation
    - Write design log / changelog
    - Document tools & languages used (Hopefully we did this on the way)
    - Add comments in code that actually mean something(Again, hopefully we did this on the way)
    - Credit ALL assets / libraries

Step 6: Educational Value
    - AGAIN, ENSURE EACH CAREER TEACHES A REAL SKILL
    - Maybe add a summary of skills learned
    - Make sure everything ties back to FBLA principles (ethics, leadership, problem-solving)

Step 7: Make Presentation
    - Create slides explaining concept, design, and educational value 
    - Write demo script
    - Practice professional delivery with friends and parents
    - Prepare Q&A answers so we are not completely taken off-guard

REMEMBER!!!!
STICK TO THIS PLEASE!
