# Pathways - FBLA Computer Game & Simulation Programming

Pathways is a Unity-based **career readiness simulation platform** developed for the **2026 FBLA Computer Game & Simulation Programming** event.
The project focuses on helping users explore careers and devlop essential work-ready skills through interactive simulations and decision-based gameplay.

---

## Overview

Pathways places players in a variety of simulated professional scenarios where they must make decisions, manage responsibilities, and develop skills relevant to real-world careers. Through multiple simulations and systems, players learn how different choices impact performance, stress, and long-term outcomes.

Rather than focusing on a single job or mechanic, Pathways is designed as a **modular platform**, allowing for the exploration of different career paths and employability skills such as time management, prioritization, communication, and adaptability.

## Purpose & Objectives

The primary goals of Pathways are to:

- Introduce players to wide range of career paths
- Simulate real-world workplace scenarios and decision-making
- Develop work-ready skills through interactive systems
- Encourage strategic thinking, responsibility, and adaptability
- Provide meaningful feedback based on player choices
